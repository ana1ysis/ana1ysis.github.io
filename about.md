I'm Clark Lemke, a recent DPhil (PhD) graduate of Physics and Neuroscience from [FMRIB](http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/divisions/fmrib) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), UK. I use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [MATLAB](www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) daily after picking them up during my MSc and DPhil.
