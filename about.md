### About Me
I'm Clark Lemke, a recent DPhil (PhD) graduate of Physics and Neuroscience from [FMRIB](http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/divisions/fmrib) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), UK. I use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [MATLAB](www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) daily after picking them up during my MSc and DPhil.

### Interests
 * I play soccer/football with [Mansfield Road FC](http://www.mansfieldroad.co.uk/) who compete in the [Oxfordshire Senior League](http://fulltime.thefa.com/Index.do?league=5277609).
 * I am an avid [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) player. I play online primarly on [KGS](https://www.gokgs.com/) and [Tygem](http://www.tygemgo.com/) and play at a 3 dan level.
 * I'm a huge motorcycle nerd - particularly bikes made between 1960 and 1980. I've owned a few different bikes and rebuilt a 1972 CB750 (it's beautiful!).
