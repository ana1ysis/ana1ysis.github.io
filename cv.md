## Experience

* Fellow, Science 2 Data Science, London, UK, 2016-Present
    * Processed large amounts of clickstream data to gain a deep understanding of user behavior as users navigate a market comparison website.
    * Identified ‘alike’ user sessions and predicted whether a user is likely to drop-off using cluster analysis, machine learning and directed graphical models.
* Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, 2015-2016
    * Cleaned and analyzed noisy time series data and organized experiments in collaboration with psychiatrists and psychologists.
* Doctoral Research, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, 2011-2015
    * Designed, programmed and implemented novel approaches to measure neurotransmitters.
    * Analyzed large data sets using time series analysis and performed statistical analysis of results to determine patterns and significance.
    * Gave invited talks and collaborated with scientists across multiple departments at the University of Oxford, McGill University and the University of British Columbia.
* Module Instructor, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, 2011-2015
    * Gave lectures to M. Sc., and Ph. D. students (~50 students a year) as part of the Oxford graduate program on the physics of MRI.
* Masters Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, 2009-2011
    * Modeled the complicated structure of a sustainable plastic alternative.
    * Provided critical information required for commercialization by the forestry industry resulting in the construction of a $32.4 million production facility. 
* Research Assistant, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Surrey Canada, 2006-2008
    * Formulated Monte Carlo simulations to model, analyze and plan radiation therapy for cancer patients resulting in improved treatment planning accuracy.
    * Research resulted in the commissioning of a new treatment method.
