## Experience

* Fellow, [Science 2 Data Science](http://www.s2ds.org/), London, UK, 2016-Present
    * Processed large amounts of clickstream data to gain a deep understanding of user behavior as users navigate a market comparison website.
    * Identified ‘alike’ user sessions and predicted whether a user is likely to drop-off using cluster analysis, machine learning and directed graphical models.
* Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, [University of Oxford](http://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/), Oxford, UK, 2015-2016
    * Cleaned and analyzed noisy time series data and organized experiments in collaboration with psychiatrists and psychologists.
* Doctoral Research, [University of Oxford](http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/divisions/fmrib), Oxford, UK, 2011-2015
    * Designed, programmed and implemented novel approaches to measure neurotransmitters.
    * Analyzed large data sets using time series analysis and performed statistical analysis of results to determine patterns and significance.
    * Gave invited talks and collaborated with scientists across multiple departments at the University of Oxford, McGill University and the University of British Columbia.
* Module Instructor, [University of Oxford](http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/divisions/fmrib), Oxford, UK, 2011-2015
    * Gave lectures to M. Sc., and Ph. D. students (~50 students a year) as part of the Oxford graduate program on the physics of MRI.
* Masters Research, [University of British Columbia](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~michal/), Vancouver, Canada, 2009-2011
    * Modeled the complicated structure of a sustainable plastic alternative.

* Research Assistant, [British Columbia Cancer Agency](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/), Surrey Canada, 2006-2008
    * Formulated Monte Carlo simulations to model, analyze and plan radiation therapy for cancer patients resulting in improved treatment planning accuracy.
    * Research resulted in the commissioning of a new treatment method.
